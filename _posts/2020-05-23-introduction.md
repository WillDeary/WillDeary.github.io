Welcome to my first blog post. It is great to have you here. I decided to create these blogs 
as a way for me to express my views and share my experiences. 

## Who am I?

I am a British fencer who competes for GBR at senior international events, at the time of 
writing i am the British national sabre champion and GBR ranked number 1 fencer with my hopes 
set on the now postponed 2020 (2021) Olympic games.  
**What else about me?**  
I am a computer science student from Kings College London. I always had a passion for playing computer games as 
a child, in fact my mother tells me the only reason I learnt to read as a child was because i wanted to play Monkey 
Island (probably not a game for a young child but oh well...).  
When I turned 18 I had the opportunity to move to London to pursue my fencing training with the British national team
being funded via UKSport. This was a brilliant time for me, moving to London, training "full-time" and almost
living by myself. I say almost because I was very fortunate for a lovely woman to let me stay in her house 
while i was training, though she was extremely busy so for the most part I was by myself.  
So this dream of being a full-time athlete... Let me tell you, it gets real boring. We trained 5 days a week
and most of the time it was 9am-3pm. This gave me most of the afternoon and the evening free. At 18 what 
excitement this was, 7 hours free to play computer games! Great! Well, no, after a few months of playing computer 
games non-stop, it gets a little dull. So that was how I ended up teaching myself how to program. I think this 
bewildered my Father as he had been trying to teach me how to program for years, and i had no interest in it.. Oops.

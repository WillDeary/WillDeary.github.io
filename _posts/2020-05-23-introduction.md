Welcome to my first blog post. It is great to have you here. I decided to create these blogs 
as a way for me to express my views and share my experiences. 

## Who am I?

I am a British fencer who competes for GBR at senior international events, at the time of 
writing i am the British national sabre champion and GBR ranked number 1 fencer with my hopes 
set on the now postponed 2020 (2021) Olympic games.  
  
**What else about me?**
  
I am a computer science student from Kings College London. I always had a passion for playing computer games as 
a child, in fact my mother tells me the only reason I learnt to read as a child was because i wanted to play Monkey 
Island (probably not a game for a young child but oh well...).  

When I turned 18 I had the opportunity to move to London to pursue my fencing training with the British national team
being funded via UKSport. So I delayed going to university and jumped upon this chance to train full-time.  
This was a brilliant time for me, moving to London, training "full-time" and almost
living by myself. I say almost because I was very fortunate for a lovely woman to let me stay in her house 
while i was training, though she was extremely busy so for the most part I was by myself.

So this dream of being a full-time athlete... Let me tell you, it gets real boring. We trained 5 days a week
and most of the time it was 9am-3pm. This gave me most of the afternoon and the evening free. At 18 what 
excitement this was, 7 hours free to play computer games! Great! Well, no, after a few months of playing computer 
games non-stop, it gets a little dull. So that was how I ended up teaching myself how to program. I think this 
bewildered my Father as he had been trying to teach me how to program for years, and I had no interest in it.. Oops.  
So here I was learning how to make very very basic computer games and websites. So, i thought why don't I do this
for my degree. (I had originally applied for aeronautical engineering. :sleeping:).  
That's how I became a programmer. I finished my first two years of uni, and now have nearly finished my year 
hiatus, which was to train for the Olympics. Now that the Corona virus has got in the way I will have to have another 
year off. What a shame...

Now I live and train in Germany, until the Olympic cycle is over. This was supposed to be in April, however Corona 
struck a few weeks before the last Olympic qualifying event, and now the who qualifying period has been put 
on hold for a year. So when the virus settles down I'll be back in Germany training with the guys there. This experience 
has been brilliant. Firstly, living in another country not being able to speak the language was something i never 
thought i would experience. Secondly, I have learnt a lot by training with the Germans, and it has shown me 
the importance of having a close knit team environment and how that can lead to success. The German team I 
train with has already qualified for the Olympics.

With my now several years of programming experience, my old fencing coach pitched an idea to me on how we could 
improve how physical education and use health & wellbeing to monitor children at schools. That was how we created 
[Record Of Fitness](https://www.recordoffitness.com).  
Then during the lockdown we stripped down Record Of Fitness (ROF) and created a lite version for everyone to use 
in lockdown. [BBFit](https://www.recordoffitness.com/bbfit).  
Creating these two apps taught me a tremendous amount on how web applications work, and creating a good work 
environment, without getting too distracted with life and the many things it throws at you. 
I am a strong believer of use what time you have wisely, and really, this lockdown is the perfect time for 
me to finish as much of ROF as I can.

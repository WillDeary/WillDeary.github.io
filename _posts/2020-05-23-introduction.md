Welcome to my first blog post. It is great to have you here. I decided to create these blogs as a way for me to express my views and share my experiences. 

## Who am I?

I am a British fencer who competes for GBR at senior international events, at the time of 
writing i am the British national sabre champion and GBR ranked number 1 fencer with my hopes 
set on the now postponed 2020 (2021) Olympic games.
